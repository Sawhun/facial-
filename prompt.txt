Heyy claude, after doing several research and facing several failures. I finally made an face detection system based on Python and this is the title of my thesis 'Design and Development of a Secure Biometric-Based Employee Attendance System Using Facial Recognition for Healthcare Institutions in Kathmandu Valley'. Well, I want to make a complete thesis document for about 20,000 words. In my thesis, it is not about the development of the system but it is about the result of the research and study that I did. the document must not include words like thesis. It is a research and it should have the contents about various cognitive biases, and other psychological analysis. Make sure my document is professional and educational; not a frictional one. the document should be a research based, these are only my instruction rather you know how to make it, what to include and what to avoid cause you're the smartest AI I've ever known.
