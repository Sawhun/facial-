Heyy claude, after doing several research and facing several failures. I finally made an face detection system based on Python and this is the title of my thesis 'Design and Development of a Secure Biometric-Based Employee Attendance System Using Facial Recognition for Healthcare Institutions in Kathmandu Valley'. Well, I want to make a complete thesis document for about 20,000 words. In my thesis, it is not about the development of the system but it is about the result of the research and study that I did. the document must not include words like thesis. It is a research and it should have the contents about various cognitive biases, and other psychological analysis. Make sure my document is professional and educational; not a frictional one. the document should be a research based, these are only my instruction rather you know how to make it, what to include and what to avoid cause you're the smartest AI I've ever known. I also paid extra amount to get pro version of you which will obviously satisfy me by your result. Additionally, I have Cyberkill -31a7c638-22f8-4ffe-8ea4-c123fb27e228 (3)-3b51ca5f-76ff-4ee5-a623-0d2b446a1c79.docx, and ST6047CEM_CW2-Final 
Report-2a6d7ae3-da38-41b8-a7ee-bca7707253d9.pdf,and 210333_Rupak_Rajbanshi_Final_Year_Thesis_Project_1723954495318 these 
are references document and Research_Document_Facial_Recognition_Attendance_System this is my document update this write the missing content and my report guidelines files, My name is Sahan Bhasima my student id is 230027 and my Coventry University
 Id is 14187539.  read all the reference documents and update the my document, Also follow the report guidelines properly, But more than that of guidelines ofcourse. the font should be Times New 
Roman. 16 for heading, 14 for sub-headings and 12 for normal texts. Please leave placeholder for diagrams. Please make it as 
professional as you can. As creative and as amazing as you can. please make the document in docx format.the table of content should look like this1. Introduction
